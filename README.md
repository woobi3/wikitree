WLB (Wikipedia Leader Board)
 
 This program starts from a root wikipedia page (by default Philosophy) and clicks on the first article link, if the article has been seen go to the next unseen link.  I want to impliment a way of seeing a data tree and simply visualise the data.  It would be cool to view this data and see where the roots end and where new ones start and if any pattern can be recognized.

 Timeline:
 [] Need to get wikipedia link filtering working
 [] get a list of the links and go to the link that you have not been to
 [] find out how to store a link so you do not go back to the root or any other seen links
 [] if page only has seen links go back until you have an unclicked link
 [] 

 Experiments:
 [] What would other roots give you
 [] How to visulize data structure
